. .TH “BUNDLE-INSTALL” “1” “April 2016” “” “” . .SH “NAME”
fBbundle-installfR - Install the dependencies specified in your <a
href="../templates/Gemfile.html">Gemfile</a> . .SH “SYNOPSIS” fBbundle
installfR [--<a href="=DIRECTORY">binstubs</a>] [--clean] [--full-index]
[--gemfile=GEMFILE] [--jobs=NUMBER] [--local] [--deployment] [--force]
[--no-cache] [--no-prune] [--path PATH] [--system] [--quiet]
[--retry=NUMBER] [--shebang] [--standalone[=GROUP[ GROUP...]]]
[--trust-policy=POLICY] [--without=GROUP[ GROUP...]] [--with=GROUP[
GROUP...]] . .SH “DESCRIPTION” Install the gems specified in your
Gemfile(5). If this is the first time you run bundle install (and a
fBGemfile.lockfR does not exist), <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will fetch all remote sources,
resolve dependencies and install all needed gems. . .P If a
fBGemfile.lockfR does exist, and you have not updated your Gemfile(5), <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will fetch all remote sources, but
use the dependencies specified in the fBGemfile.lockfR instead of resolving
dependencies. . .P If a fBGemfile.lockfR does exist, and you have updated
your Gemfile(5), <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will use the
dependencies in the fBGemfile.lockfR for all gems that you did not update,
but will re-resolve the dependencies of gems that you did update. You can
find more information about this update process below under fICONSERVATIVE
UPDATINGfR. . .SH “OPTIONS” . .TP fB--binstubs[=<directory>]fR Creates a
directory (defaults to fB~/binfR) and place any executables from the gem
there. These executables run in Bundler&#39;s context. If used, you might
add this directory to your environment&#39;s fBPATHfR variable. For
instance, if the fBrailsfR gem comes with a fBrailsfR executable, this flag
will create a fBbin/railsfR executable that ensures that all referred
dependencies will be resolved using the bundled gems. . .TP fB--cleanfR On
finishing the installation <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> is
going to remove any gems not present in the current Gemfile(5). Don&#39;t
worry, gems currently in use will not be removed. . .TP fB--full-indexfR <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will not call Rubygems&#39; API
endpoint (default) but download and cache a (currently big) index file of
all gems. Performance can be improved for large bundles that seldomly
change by enabling this option. . .TP fB--gemfile=&lt;gemfile&gt;fR The
location of the Gemfile(5) which <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> should use. This defaults to a
Gemfile(5) in the current working directory. In general, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will assume that the location of
the Gemfile(5) is also the project&#39;s root and will try to find
fBGemfile.lockfR and fBvendor/cachefR relative to this location. . .TP
fB--jobs=[<number>]fR The maximum number of parallel download and install
jobs. The default is fB1fR. . .TP fB--localfR Do not attempt to connect to
fBrubygems.orgfR. Instead, <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will
use the gems already present in Rubygems&#39; cache or in fBvendor/cachefR.
Note that if a appropriate platform-specific gem exists on fBrubygems.orgfR
it will not be found. . .TP fB--deploymentfR In fIdeployment modefR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will 'roll-out&#39; the bundle for
production or CI use. Please check carefully if you want to have this
option enabled in your development environment. . .TP fB--forcefR Force
download every gem, even if the required versions are already available
locally. . .TP fB--systemfR Installs the gems specified in the bundle to
the system&#39;s Rubygems location. This overrides any previous
fIrememberedfR use of fB--pathfR. . .TP fB--no-cachefR Do not update the
cache in fBvendor/cachefR with the newly bundled gems. This does not remove
any gems in the cache but keeps the newly bundled gems from being cached
during the install. . .TP fB--no-prunefR Don&#39;t remove stale gems from
the cache when the installation finishes. . .TP fB--path=&lt;path&gt;fR The
location to install the specified gems to. This defaults to Rubygems&#39;
setting. <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> shares this location
with Rubygems, fBgem install ...fR will have gem installed there, too.
Therefore, gems installed without a fB--path ...fR setting will show up by
calling fBgem listfR. Accodingly, gems installed to other locations will
not get listed. This setting is a fIremembered optionfR. . .TP fB--quietfR
Do not print progress information to the standard output. Instead, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will exit using a status code
(fB$?fR). . .TP fB--retry=[<number>]fR Retry failed network or git requests
for fInumberfR times. . .TP fB--shebang=&lt;ruby-executable&gt;fR Uses the
specified ruby executable (usually fBrubyfR) to execute the scripts created
with fB--binstubsfR. In addition, if you use fB--binstubsfR together with
fB--shebang jrubyfR these executables will be changed to execute fBjrubyfR
instead. . .TP fB--standalone[=<list>]fR Makes a bundle that can work
without depending on Rubygems or <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> at runtime. A space separated list
of groups to install has to be specified. <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> creates a directory named
fBbundlefR and installs the bundle there. It also generates a
fBbundle/bundler/setup.rbfR file to replace Bundler&#39;s own setup in the
manner required. Using this option implicitly sets fBpathfR, which is a
fIremembered optionfR. . .TP fB--trust-policy=[<policy>]fR Apply the
Rubygems security policy fIpolicyfR, where policy is one of
fBHighSecurityfR, fBMediumSecurityfR, fBLowSecurityfR,
fBAlmostNoSecurityfR, or fBNoSecurityfR. For more details, please see the
Rubygems signing documentation linked below in fISEE ALSOfR. . .TP
fB--without=&lt;list&gt;fR A space-separated list of groups referencing
gems to skip during installation. If a group is given that is in the
remembered list of groups given to --with, it is removed from that list.
This is a fIremembered optionfR. . .TP fB--with=&lt;list&gt;fR A
space-separated list of groups referencing gems to install. If an optional
group is given it is installed. If a group is given that is in the
remembered list of groups given to --without, it is removed from that list.
This is a fIremembered optionfR. . .SH “DEPLOYMENT MODE” Bundler&#39;s
defaults are optimized for development. To switch to defaults optimized for
deployment and for CI, use the fB--deploymentfR flag. Do not activate
deployment mode on development machines, as it will cause an error when the
Gemfile(5) is modified. . .IP “1.” 4 A fBGemfile.lockfR is required. . .IP
To ensure that the same versions of the gems you developed with and tested
with are also used in deployments, a fBGemfile.lockfR is required. . .IP
This is mainly to ensure that you remember to check your fBGemfile.lockfR
into version control. . .IP “2.” 4 The fBGemfile.lockfR must be up to date
. .IP In development, you can modify your Gemfile(5) and re-run fBbundle
installfR to fIconservatively updatefR your fBGemfile.lockfR snapshot. .
.IP In deployment, your fBGemfile.lockfR should be up-to-date with changes
made in your Gemfile(5). . .IP “3.” 4 Gems are installed to
fBvendor/bundlefR not your default system location . .IP In development,
it&#39;s convenient to share the gems used in your application with other
applications and other scripts run on the system. . .IP In deployment,
isolation is a more important default. In addition, the user deploying the
application may not have permission to install gems to the system, or the
web server may not have permission to read them. . .IP As a result,
fBbundle install --deploymentfR installs gems to the fBvendor/bundlefR
directory in the application. This may be overridden using the fB--pathfR
option. . .IP “” 0 . .SH “SUDO USAGE” By default, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> installs gems to the same location
as fBgem installfR. . .P In some cases, that location may not be writable
by your Unix user. In that case, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will stage everything in a
temporary directory, then ask you for your fBsudofR password in order to
copy the gems into their system location. . .P From your perspective, this
is identical to installing them gems directly into the system. . .P You
should never use fBsudo bundle installfR. This is because several other
steps in fBbundle installfR must be performed as the current user: . .IP
“(bu” 4 Updating your fBGemfile.lockfR . .IP “(bu” 4 Updating your
fBvendor/cachefR, if necessary . .IP “(bu” 4 Checking out private git
repositories using your user&#39;s SSH keys . .IP “” 0 . .P Of these three,
the first two could theoretically be performed by fBchownfRing the
resulting files to fB$SUDO_USERfR. The third, however, can only be
performed by actually invoking the fBgitfR command as the current user.
Therefore, git gems are downloaded and installed into fB~/.bundlefR rather
than $GEM_HOME or $BUNDLE_PATH. . .P As a result, you should run fBbundle
installfR as the current user, and <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will ask for your password if it
is needed to put the gems into their final location. . .SH “INSTALLING
GROUPS” By default, fBbundle installfR will install all gems in all groups
in your Gemfile(5), except those declared for a different platform. . .P
However, you can explicitly tell <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> to skip installing certain groups
with the fB--withoutfR option. This option takes a space-separated list of
groups. . .P While the fB--withoutfR option will skip fIinstallingfR the
gems in the specified groups, it will still fIdownloadfR those gems and use
them to resolve the dependencies of every gem in your Gemfile(5). . .P This
is so that installing a different set of groups on another machine (such as
a production server) will not change the gems and versions that you have
already developed and tested against. . .P fBBundler offers a rock-solid
guarantee that the third-party code you are running in development and
testing is also the third-party code you are running in production. You can
choose to exclude some of that code in different environments, but you will
never be caught flat-footed by different versions of third-party code being
used in different environments.fR . .P For a simple illustration, consider
the following Gemfile(5): . .IP “” 4 . .nf</p>

<p>source 'https://rubygems.org&#39;</p>

<p>gem 'sinatra&#39;</p>

<p>group :production do</p>

<pre>gem \&#39;rack\-perftools\-profiler\&#39;</pre>

<p>end . .fi . .IP “” 0 . .P In this case, fBsinatrafR depends on any version
of Rack (fB&gt;= 1.0fR), while fBrack-perftools-profilerfR depends on 1.x
(fB~&gt; 1.0fR). . .P When you run fBbundle install --without productionfR
in development, we look at the dependencies of fBrack-perftools-profilerfR
as well. That way, you do not spend all your time developing against Rack
2.0, using new APIs unavailable in Rack 1.x, only to have <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> switch to Rack 1.2 when the
fBproductionfR group fIisfR used. . .P This should not cause any problems
in practice, because we do not attempt to fBinstallfR the gems in the
excluded groups, and only evaluate as part of the dependency resolution
process. . .P This also means that you cannot include different versions of
the same gem in different groups, because doing so would result in
different sets of dependencies used in development and production. Because
of the vagaries of the dependency resolution process, this usually affects
more than just the gems you list in your Gemfile(5), and can (surprisingly)
radically change the gems you are using. . .SH “REMEMBERED OPTIONS” Some
options (marked above in the fIOPTIONSfR section) are remembered between
calls to fBbundle installfR, and by the <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime. . .P For instance, if you
run fBbundle install --without testfR, a subsequent call to fBbundle
installfR that does not include a fB--withoutfR flag will remember your
previous choice. . .P In addition, a call to fBBundler.setupfR will not
attempt to make the gems in those groups available on the Ruby load path,
as they were not installed. . .P The settings that are remembered are: .
.TP fB--deploymentfR At runtime, this remembered setting will also result
in <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> raising an exception if the
fBGemfile.lockfR is out of date. . .TP fB--pathfR Subsequent calls to
fBbundle installfR will install gems to the directory originally passed to
fB--pathfR. The <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime will
look for gems in that location. You can revert this option by running
fBbundle install --systemfR. . .TP fB--binstubsfR <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will update the executables every
subsequent call to fBbundle installfR. . .TP fB--withoutfR As described
above, <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will skip the gems
specified by fB--withoutfR in subsequent calls to fBbundle installfR. The
<a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> runtime will also not try to
make the gems in the skipped groups available. . .SH “THE GEMFILE.LOCK”
When you run fBbundle installfR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will persist the full names and
versions of all gems that you used (including dependencies of the gems
specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a file called fBGemfile.lockfR. . .P <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> uses this file in all subsequent
calls to fBbundle installfR, which guarantees that you always use the same
exact code, even as your application moves across machines. . .P Because of
the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly small change (for
instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of a gem in your
Gemfile(5)) can result in radically different gems being needed to satisfy
all dependencies. . .P As a result, you fBSHOULDfR check your
fBGemfile.lockfR into version control. If you do not, every machine that
checks out your repository (including your production server) will resolve
all dependencies again, which will result in different versions of
third-party code being used if fBanyfR of the gems in the Gemfile(5) or any
of their dependencies have been updated. . .SH “CONSERVATIVE UPDATING” When
you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run fBbundle installfR, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will update only the gems that you
modified. . .P In other words, if a gem that you fBdid not modifyfR worked
before you called fBbundle installfR, it will continue to use the exact
same versions of all dependencies as it used before the update. . .P
Let&#39;s take a look at an example. Here&#39;s your original Gemfile(5): .
.IP “” 4 . .nf</p>

<p>source 'https://rubygems.org&#39;</p>

<p>gem 'actionpack&#39;, '2.3.8&#39; gem 'activemerchant&#39; . .fi . .IP “” 0
. .P In this case, both fBactionpackfR and fBactivemerchantfR depend on
fBactivesupportfR. The fBactionpackfR gem depends on fBactivesupport
2.3.8fR and fBrack ~&gt; 1.1.0fR, while the fBactivemerchantfR gem depends
on fBactivesupport &gt;= 2.3.2fR, fBbraintree &gt;= 2.0.0fR, and fBbuilder
&gt;= 2.0.0fR. . .P When the dependencies are first resolved, <a
href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> will select fBactivesupport
2.3.8fR, which satisfies the requirements of both gems in your Gemfile(5).
. .P Next, you modify your Gemfile(5) to: . .IP “” 4 . .nf</p>

<p>source 'https://rubygems.org&#39;</p>

<p>gem 'actionpack&#39;, '3.0.0.rc&#39; gem 'activemerchant&#39; . .fi . .IP
“” 0 . .P The fBactionpack 3.0.0.rcfR gem has a number of new dependencies,
and updates the fBactivesupportfR dependency to fB= 3.0.0.rcfR and the
fBrackfR dependency to fB~&gt; 1.2.1fR. . .P When you run fBbundle
installfR, <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> notices that you
changed the fBactionpackfR gem, but not the fBactivemerchantfR gem. It
evaluates the gems currently being used to satisfy its requirements: . .TP
fBactivesupport 2.3.8fR also used to satisfy a dependency in
fBactivemerchantfR, which is not being updated . .TP fBrack ~&gt; 1.1.0fR
not currently being used to satisfy another dependency . .P Because you did
not explicitly ask to update fBactivemerchantfR, you would not expect it to
suddenly stop working after updating fBactionpackfR. However, satisfying
the new fBactivesupport 3.0.0.rcfR dependency of actionpack requires
updating one of its dependencies. . .P Even though fBactivemerchantfR
declares a very loose dependency that theoretically matches fBactivesupport
3.0.0.rcfR, <a href="../../../Bundler.html">Bundler</a> treats gems in your
Gemfile(5) that have not changed as an atomic unit together with their
dependencies. In this case, the fBactivemerchantfR dependency is treated as
fBactivemerchant 1.7.1 + activesupport 2.3.8fR, so fBbundle installfR will
report that it cannot update fBactionpackfR. . .P To explicitly update
fBactionpackfR, including its dependencies which other gems in the
Gemfile(5) still depend on, run fBbundle update actionpackfR (see fBbundle
update(1)fR). . .P fBSummaryfR: In general, after making a change to the
Gemfile(5) , you should first try to run fBbundle installfR, which will
guarantee that no other gems in the Gemfile(5) are impacted by the change.
If that does not work, run bundle update(1) fIbundle-update.1.htmlfR. . .SH
