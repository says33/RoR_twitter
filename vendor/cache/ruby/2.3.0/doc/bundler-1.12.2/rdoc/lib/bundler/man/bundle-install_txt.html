BUNDLE-INSTALL(1)</p>

<p>1mNAME0m</p>

<pre>1mbundle-install 22m- Install the dependencies specified in your Gemfile</pre>

<p>1mSYNOPSIS0m</p>

<pre>1mbundle   install   22m[--binstubs[=DIRECTORY]]   [--clean]  [--full-index]
[--gemfile=GEMFILE] [--jobs=NUMBER] [--local] [--deployment]  [--force]
[--no-cache]    [--no-prune]   [--path   PATH]   [--system]   [--quiet]

[--trust-policy=POLICY]   [--without=GROUP[  GROUP...]]  [--with=GROUP[
GROUP...]]</pre>

<p>1mDESCRIPTION0m</p>

<pre>Install the gems specified in your Gemfile(5). If  this  is  the  first
time  you  run  bundle  install  (and  a  1mGemfile.lock 22mdoes not exist),
Bundler will fetch all remote sources, resolve dependencies and install
all needed gems.

If a 1mGemfile.lock 22mdoes exist, and you have not updated your Gemfile(5),
Bundler will fetch all remote sources, but use the dependencies  speci-
fied in the 1mGemfile.lock 22minstead of resolving dependencies.

If  a  1mGemfile.lock  22mdoes  exist, and you have updated your Gemfile(5),
Bundler will use the dependencies in the 1mGemfile.lock 22mfor all gems that
you  did  not update, but will re-resolve the dependencies of gems that
you did update. You can find more information about this update process
below under 4mCONSERVATIVE24m 4mUPDATING24m.</pre>

<p>1mOPTIONS0m</p>

<pre>1m--binstubs[=&lt;directory&gt;]0m
       Creates  a  directory (defaults to 1m~/bin22m) and place any executa-
       bles from the gem there. These executables run in Bundler&#39;s con-
       text.  If  used,  you  might add this directory to your environ-
       ment&#39;s 1mPATH 22mvariable. For instance, if the 1mrails 22mgem comes  with
       a 1mrails 22mexecutable, this flag will create a 1mbin/rails 22mexecutable
       that ensures that all referred  dependencies  will  be  resolved
       using the bundled gems.

1m--clean0m
       On  finishing  the  installation  Bundler is going to remove any
       gems not present in the current Gemfile(5).  Don&#39;t  worry,  gems
       currently in use will not be removed.

1m--full-index0m
       Bundler will not call Rubygems&#39; API endpoint (default) but down-
       load and cache a (currently big) index file of all gems. Perfor-
       mance  can be improved for large bundles that seldomly change by
       enabling this option.

1m--gemfile=&lt;gemfile&gt;0m
       The location of the Gemfile(5) which Bundler  should  use.  This
       defaults  to  a  Gemfile(5) in the current working directory. In
       general, Bundler will assume that the location of the Gemfile(5)
       is also the project&#39;s root and will try to find 1mGemfile.lock 22mand
       1mvendor/cache 22mrelative to this location.

1m--jobs=[&lt;number&gt;]0m
       The maximum number of parallel download and  install  jobs.  The
       default is 1m122m.

1m--local0m
       Do not attempt to connect to 1mrubygems.org22m. Instead, Bundler will
       use the gems already present  in  Rubygems&#39;  cache  or  in  1mven-0m
       1mdor/cache22m.  Note  that  if  a  appropriate platform-specific gem
       exists on 1mrubygems.org 22mit will not be found.

1m--deployment0m
       In 4mdeployment24m 4mmode24m, Bundler will &#39;roll-out&#39; the bundle for  pro-
       duction  or  CI  use. Please check carefully if you want to have
       this option enabled in your development environment.

1m--force0m
       Force download every gem, even  if  the  required  versions  are
       already available locally.

1m--system0m
       Installs  the  gems  specified  in  the  bundle  to the system&#39;s
       Rubygems location. This overrides any previous 4mremembered24m use of
       1m--path22m.

1m--no-cache0m
       Do  not  update the cache in 1mvendor/cache 22mwith the newly bundled
       gems. This does not remove any gems in the cache but  keeps  the
       newly bundled gems from being cached during the install.

1m--no-prune0m
       Don&#39;t  remove  stale  gems  from the cache when the installation
       finishes.

1m--path=&lt;path&gt;0m
       The location to install the specified gems to. This defaults  to
       Rubygems&#39;  setting.  Bundler shares this location with Rubygems,
       1mgem install ... 22mwill have gem installed there,  too.  Therefore,
       gems  installed  without  a  1m--path  ... 22msetting will show up by
       calling 1mgem list22m. Accodingly, gems installed to other  locations
       will not get listed. This setting is a 4mremembered24m 4moption24m.

1m--quiet0m
       Do  not  print  progress  information  to  the  standard output.
       Instead, Bundler will exit using a status code (1m$?22m).

1m--retry=[&lt;number&gt;]0m
       Retry failed network or git requests for 4mnumber24m times.

1m--shebang=&lt;ruby-executable&gt;0m
       Uses the specified ruby executable (usually 1mruby22m) to execute the
       scripts  created with 1m--binstubs22m. In addition, if you use 1m--bin-0m
       1mstubs 22mtogether with 1m--shebang jruby 22mthese  executables  will  be
       changed to execute 1mjruby 22minstead.

1m--standalone[=&lt;list&gt;]0m
       Makes  a  bundle  that can work without depending on Rubygems or
       Bundler at runtime. A space separated list of groups to  install
       has  to  be  specified. Bundler creates a directory named 1mbundle0m
       and  installs  the  bundle  there.  It  also  generates  a  1mbun-0m
       1mdle/bundler/setup.rb  22mfile to replace Bundler&#39;s own setup in the
       manner required. Using this option implicitly sets  1mpath22m,  which
       is a 4mremembered24m 4moption24m.

1m--trust-policy=[&lt;policy&gt;]0m
       Apply  the  Rubygems security policy 4mpolicy24m, where policy is one
       of 1mHighSecurity22m, 1mMediumSecurity22m, 1mLowSecurity22m,  1mAlmostNoSecurity22m,
       or 1mNoSecurity22m. For more details, please see the Rubygems signing
       documentation linked below in 4mSEE24m 4mALSO24m.

1m--without=&lt;list&gt;0m
       A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to skip during
       installation. If a group is given that is in the remembered list
       of groups given to --with, it is removed from that list. This is
       a 4mremembered24m 4moption24m.

1m--with=&lt;list&gt;0m
       A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to install. If
       an optional group is given it is installed. If a group is  given
       that  is in the remembered list of groups given to --without, it
       is removed from that list. This is a 4mremembered24m 4moption24m.</pre>

<p>1mDEPLOYMENT MODE0m</p>

<pre>Bundler&#39;s defaults are optimized for development. To switch to defaults
optimized  for deployment and for CI, use the 1m--deployment 22mflag. Do not
activate deployment mode on development machines, as it will  cause  an
error when the Gemfile(5) is modified.

1.  A 1mGemfile.lock 22mis required.

    To ensure that the same versions of the gems you developed with and
    tested with  are  also  used  in  deployments,  a  1mGemfile.lock  22mis
    required.

    This  is  mainly  to  ensure  that  you remember to check your 1mGem-0m
    1mfile.lock 22minto version control.

2.  The 1mGemfile.lock 22mmust be up to date

    In development, you can modify your Gemfile(5)  and  re-run  1mbundle0m
    1minstall 22mto 4mconservatively24m 4mupdate24m your 1mGemfile.lock 22msnapshot.

    In  deployment, your 1mGemfile.lock 22mshould be up-to-date with changes
    made in your Gemfile(5).

3.  Gems are installed to 1mvendor/bundle 22mnot your default  system  loca-
    tion

    In  development,  it&#39;s  convenient  to  share the gems used in your
    application with other applications and other scripts  run  on  the
    system.

    In  deployment, isolation is a more important default. In addition,
    the user deploying the  application  may  not  have  permission  to
    install  gems to the system, or the web server may not have permis-
    sion to read them.

    As a result, 1mbundle install --deployment 22minstalls gems to the  1mven-0m
    1mdor/bundle  22mdirectory  in  the  application. This may be overridden
    using the 1m--path 22moption.</pre>

<p>1mSUDO USAGE0m</p>

<pre>By default, Bundler installs gems to the same location as 1mgem install22m.

In some cases, that location may not be writable by your Unix user.  In
that case, Bundler will stage everything in a temporary directory, then
ask you for your 1msudo 22mpassword in order to copy  the  gems  into  their
system location.

From  your  perspective,  this  is  identical  to  installing them gems
directly into the system.

You should never use 1msudo bundle install22m. This is because several other
steps in 1mbundle install 22mmust be performed as the current user:

o   Updating your 1mGemfile.lock0m

o   Updating your 1mvendor/cache22m, if necessary

o   Checking out private git repositories using your user&#39;s SSH keys

Of  these  three,  the  first  two  could theoretically be performed by
1mchown22ming the resulting files to 1m$SUDO_USER22m.  The  third,  however,  can
only  be  performed by actually invoking the 1mgit 22mcommand as the current
user. Therefore, git gems are downloaded and installed  into  1m~/.bundle0m
rather than $GEM_HOME or $BUNDLE_PATH.

As  a  result,  you  should run 1mbundle install 22mas the current user, and
Bundler will ask for your password if it is needed to put the gems into
their final location.</pre>

<p>1mINSTALLING GROUPS0m</p>

<pre>By  default, 1mbundle install 22mwill install all gems in all groups in your
Gemfile(5), except those declared for a different platform.

However, you can explicitly tell Bundler  to  skip  installing  certain
groups  with  the 1m--without 22moption. This option takes a space-separated
list of groups.

While the 1m--without 22moption will skip 4minstalling24m the gems in the  speci-
fied  groups, it will still 4mdownload24m those gems and use them to resolve
the dependencies of every gem in your Gemfile(5).

This is so that installing a different set of groups on another machine
(such  as  a  production  server) will not change the gems and versions
that you have already developed and tested against.

1mBundler offers a rock-solid guarantee that the third-party code you are0m
1mrunning in development and testing is also the third-party code you are0m
1mrunning in production. You can choose to exclude some of that  code  in0m
1mdifferent  environments,  but  you  will never be caught flat-footed by0m
1mdifferent versions of third-party code being used in different environ-0m
1mments.0m

For a simple illustration, consider the following Gemfile(5):

    source &#39;https://rubygems.org&#39;

    gem &#39;sinatra&#39;

    group :production do
      gem &#39;rack-perftools-profiler&#39;
    end

In  this  case,  1msinatra 22mdepends on any version of Rack (1m&gt;= 1.022m), while
1mrack-perftools-profiler 22mdepends on 1.x (1m~&gt; 1.022m).

When you run 1mbundle install --without  production  22min  development,  we
look  at the dependencies of 1mrack-perftools-profiler 22mas well. That way,
you do not spend all your time developing against Rack 2.0,  using  new
APIs  unavailable  in Rack 1.x, only to have Bundler switch to Rack 1.2
when the 1mproduction 22mgroup 4mis24m used.

This should not cause any problems  in  practice,  because  we  do  not
attempt  to  1minstall 22mthe gems in the excluded groups, and only evaluate
as part of the dependency resolution process.

This also means that you cannot include different versions of the  same
gem  in  different  groups,  because doing so would result in different
sets of dependencies used in development and production. Because of the
vagaries  of  the  dependency  resolution process, this usually affects
more than just the gems you list in your Gemfile(5), and can  (surpris-
ingly) radically change the gems you are using.</pre>

<p>1mREMEMBERED OPTIONS0m</p>

<pre>Some  options  (marked  above  in  the  4mOPTIONS24m section) are remembered
between calls to 1mbundle install22m, and by the Bundler runtime.

For instance, if you run 1mbundle install --without  test22m,  a  subsequent
call  to  1mbundle  install  22mthat  does not include a 1m--without 22mflag will
remember your previous choice.

In addition, a call to 1mBundler.setup 22mwill not attempt to make the  gems
in  those  groups  available  on  the  Ruby load path, as they were not
installed.

The settings that are remembered are:

1m--deployment0m
       At runtime, this remembered setting will also result in  Bundler
       raising an exception if the 1mGemfile.lock 22mis out of date.

1m--path 22mSubsequent  calls  to  1mbundle  install  22mwill install gems to the
       directory originally passed to 1m--path22m. The Bundler runtime  will
       look  for  gems  in that location. You can revert this option by
       running 1mbundle install --system22m.

1m--binstubs0m
       Bundler will update the executables  every  subsequent  call  to
       1mbundle install22m.

1m--without0m
       As  described  above,  Bundler  will  skip the gems specified by
       1m--without 22min subsequent calls to  1mbundle  install22m.  The  Bundler
       runtime will also not try to make the gems in the skipped groups
       available.</pre>

<p>1mTHE GEMFILE.LOCK0m</p>

<pre>When you run 1mbundle install22m, Bundler will persist the  full  names  and
versions  of all gems that you used (including dependencies of the gems
specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a file called 1mGemfile.lock22m.

Bundler uses this file in all subsequent calls to 1mbundle install22m, which
guarantees that you always use the same exact code, even as your appli-
cation moves across machines.

Because of the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly  small
change (for instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of a
gem in your Gemfile(5)) can result in radically  different  gems  being
needed to satisfy all dependencies.

As  a  result, you 1mSHOULD 22mcheck your 1mGemfile.lock 22minto version control.
If you do not, every machine that checks out your repository (including
your production server) will resolve all dependencies again, which will
result in different versions of third-party code being used if  1many  22mof
the  gems  in  the  Gemfile(5)  or  any of their dependencies have been
updated.</pre>

<p>1mCONSERVATIVE UPDATING0m</p>

<pre>When you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run  1mbundle  install22m,
Bundler will update only the gems that you modified.

In  other  words,  if  a  gem that you 1mdid not modify 22mworked before you
called 1mbundle install22m, it will continue to use the exact same  versions
of all dependencies as it used before the update.

Let&#39;s take a look at an example. Here&#39;s your original Gemfile(5):

    source &#39;https://rubygems.org&#39;

    gem &#39;actionpack&#39;, &#39;2.3.8&#39;
    gem &#39;activemerchant&#39;

In  this  case, both 1mactionpack 22mand 1mactivemerchant 22mdepend on 1mactivesup-0m
1mport22m. The 1mactionpack 22mgem depends on 1mactivesupport  2.3.8  22mand  1mrack  ~&gt;0m
1m1.1.022m,  while the 1mactivemerchant 22mgem depends on 1mactivesupport &gt;= 2.3.222m,
1mbraintree &gt;= 2.0.022m, and 1mbuilder &gt;= 2.0.022m.

When  the  dependencies  are  first  resolved,  Bundler   will   select
1mactivesupport  2.3.822m,  which satisfies the requirements of both gems in
your Gemfile(5).

Next, you modify your Gemfile(5) to:

    source &#39;https://rubygems.org&#39;

    gem &#39;actionpack&#39;, &#39;3.0.0.rc&#39;
    gem &#39;activemerchant&#39;

The 1mactionpack 3.0.0.rc 22mgem has  a  number  of  new  dependencies,  and
updates  the 1mactivesupport 22mdependency to 1m= 3.0.0.rc 22mand the 1mrack 22mdepen-
dency to 1m~&gt; 1.2.122m.

When you run 1mbundle install22m,  Bundler  notices  that  you  changed  the
1mactionpack  22mgem,  but not the 1mactivemerchant 22mgem. It evaluates the gems
currently being used to satisfy its requirements:

1mactivesupport 2.3.80m
       also used to satisfy a dependency in  1mactivemerchant22m,  which  is
       not being updated

1mrack ~&gt; 1.1.00m
       not currently being used to satisfy another dependency

Because  you did not explicitly ask to update 1mactivemerchant22m, you would
not expect it to suddenly stop working after updating 1mactionpack22m.  How-
ever,  satisfying  the new 1mactivesupport 3.0.0.rc 22mdependency of action-
pack requires updating one of its dependencies.

Even though 1mactivemerchant 22mdeclares a very loose dependency that  theo-
retically  matches  1mactivesupport 3.0.0.rc22m, Bundler treats gems in your
Gemfile(5) that have not changed as an atomic unit together with  their
dependencies. In this case, the 1mactivemerchant 22mdependency is treated as
1mactivemerchant 1.7.1 + activesupport  2.3.822m,  so  1mbundle  install  22mwill
report that it cannot update 1mactionpack22m.

To explicitly update 1mactionpack22m, including its dependencies which other
gems in the Gemfile(5) still depend on, run  1mbundle  update  actionpack0m
(see 1mbundle update(1)22m).

1mSummary22m:  In  general,  after  making  a change to the Gemfile(5) , you
should first try to run 1mbundle install22m, which will  guarantee  that  no
other  gems  in the Gemfile(5) are impacted by the change. If that does
not work, run bundle update(1) 4mbundle-update.1.html24m.</pre>
